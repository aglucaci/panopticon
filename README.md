# LitScan

This repository is an automated, daily situational-awareness system for
**viromics, metagenomics, and evolutionary biology**.

It continuously scans the scientific literature for emerging signals
relevant to viral evolution, global surveillance, and microbial genomics,
and publishes a public, reproducible daily brief via GitHub Pages.

## What This Repo Does

- Monitors PubMed daily for new publications in:
  - viromes & viral metagenomics
  - wastewater & urban surveillance
  - influenza & H5N1 evolution
  - human & environmental viromes
  - antimicrobial resistance (AMR) metagenomics
- Generates:
  - `latest.json` — machine-readable daily signal
  - `latest.md` — human-readable daily brief
  - `index.html` — public-facing dashboard
- Updates automatically via GitHub Actions

---

## Design Philosophy

- **Situational awareness over retrospection**
- **Predictive evolutionary mindset**
- **Static, auditable outputs**
- **No backend, no databases, no credentials**

This package is intended as durable scientific infrastructure, not a demo.

---

## Automation

This repo runs daily using GitHub Actions.  
All generated outputs are written to `/docs` and are immediately published
through GitHub Pages.
