- **[Adopting omics-based approaches to facilitate the establishment of microbial consortia to generate reproducible fermented foods with desirable properties.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41651877/)**  
  Erkang Zhang, Marcus J Claesson, Paul D Cotter · NPJ science of food · 2026  
  _The quality of fermented foods is governed by the composition, function, and interactions of their microbial communities. However, fermentations carried out using traditional approaches are often variable with respect to their composition and are difficult to …_
- **[Animal-associated jumbo phages as widespread and active modulators of gut microbiome ecology and metabolism.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41650276/)**  
  LinXing Chen, Antonio Pedro Camargo, Yiting Qin, Eugene V Koonin, Haoyu Wang, Yuanqiang Zou · Science advances · 2026  
  _Huge phages are widespread in the biosphere, yet their prevalence and ecology in the human gut remain poorly characterized. Here, we report Jug (jumbo gut) phages with genomes of 360 to 402 kilobase pairs that comprise ~1.1% of the reads in human gut metagenom…_

  Emanuele Selleri, Chiara Tarracchini, Silvia Petraro, Leonardo Mancabelli, Christian Milani, Francesca Turroni · mSystems · 2026  
- **[High-efficiency methane consumption by atmospheric methanotrophs in subsurface karst caves: The irrefutable methane sink.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41637515/)**  
  Xiaoyan Liu, Xiaoyu Cheng, Yiming Zhang, Rui Zhao, Weiqi Wang, Yang Li · Science advances · 2026  
  _Subsurface karst systems represent substantial but underexplored methane sinks, yet the identities and activities of cave-dwelling methanotrophs remain poorly characterized. We detected increased methane oxidation rates from 2.9 ± 0.1 to 90.7 ± 4.5 ng·g_

- **[Evolutionary patterns of pH1N1 and H3N2 in relation to vaccine use.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41652567/)**  
  Yi-Wen Lin, Li-Zhong Guo, Yun-Ting Tsai, Yi-Chieh Chu, Yu-Fang Lin, Kazuhiro Takemura · BMC genomics · 2026  
  _The rapid evolution of viral antigens poses a major challenge to infectious disease control, particularly for pathogens like influenza that undergo frequent antigenic changes. While deep mutational scanning and platforms such as Nextstrain have advanced our un…_
